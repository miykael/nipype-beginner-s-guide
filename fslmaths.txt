Usage: fslmaths [-dt <datatype>] <first_input> [operations and inputs] <output> [-odt <datatype>]

Datatype information:

 -dt sets the datatype used internally for calculations (default float for all except double images)
 -odt sets the output datatype (default as original image)
 Possible datatypes are: char short int float double
 Additionally "-dt input" will set the internal datatype to that of the original image

Binary operations (image-image or image-number):

  (inputs can be either an image or a number)
 -add   : add following input to current image
 -sub   : subtract following input from current image
 -mul   : multiply current image by following input
 -div   : divide current image by following input
 -rem   : modulus remainder - divide current image by following input and take remainder
 -mas   : use (following image>0) to mask current image
 -thr   : use following number to threshold current image (zero anything below the number)
 -thrp  : use following percentage (0-100) of ROBUST RANGE to threshold current image (zero
          anything below the number)
 -thrP  : use following percentage (0-100) of ROBUST RANGE of non-zero voxels and threshold below
 -uthr  : use following number to upper-threshold current image (zero anything above the number)
 -uthrp : use following percentage (0-100) of ROBUST RANGE to upper-threshold current image (zero
          anything above the number)
 -uthrP : use following percentage (0-100) of ROBUST RANGE of non-zero voxels and threshold above
 -max   : take maximum of following input and current image
 -min   : take minimum of following input and current image
 -seed  : seed random number generator with following number

Basic unary operations (algebraic operation on an image):

 -exp   : exponential
 -log   : natural logarithm
 -sqr   : square
 -sqrt  : square root
 -recip : reciprocal (1/current image)
 -abs   : absolute value
 -bin   : use (current image>0) to binarise
 -index : replace each nonzero voxel with a unique (subject to wrapping) index number
 -grid <value> <spacing> : add a 3D grid of intensity <value> with grid spacing <spacing>
 -edge  : edge strength
 -tfce <H> <E> <connectivity>: enhance with TFCE, e.g. -tfce 2 0.5 6 (maybe change 6 to 26 for
          skeletons)
 -tfceS <H> <E> <connectivity> <X> <Y> <Z> <tfce_thresh>: show support area for voxel (X,Y,Z)
 -nan   : replace NaNs (improper numbers) with 0
 -nanm  : make NaN (improper number) mask with 1 for NaN voxels, 0 otherwise
 -rand  : add uniform noise (range 0:1)
 -randn : add Gaussian noise (mean=0 sigma=1)
 -inm <mean> :  (-i i ip.c) intensity normalisation (per 3D volume mean)
 -ing <mean> :  (-I i ip.c) intensity normalisation, global 4D mean)

Matrix operations:

 -tensor_decomp : convert a 4D (6-timepoint )tensor image into L1,2,3,FA,MD,MO,V1,2,3 (remaining
                  image in pipeline is FA)

Kernel operations (set BEFORE filtering operation):

 -kernel 3D : 3x3x3 box centered on target voxel (set as default kernel)
 -kernel 2D : 3x3x1 box centered on target voxel
 -kernel box    <size>     : all voxels in a box of width <size> centered on target voxel
 -kernel boxv   <size>     : <size>x<size>x<size> box centered on target voxel, CAUTION: size
                             should be an odd number
 -kernel gauss  <sigma>    : gaussian kernel (sigma in mm, not voxels)
 -kernel sphere <size>     : all voxels in a sphere of radius <size> mm centered on target voxel
 -kernel file   <filename> : use external file as kernel

Spatial Filtering operations: N.B. all options apart from -s use the kernel _previously_ specified
                              by –kernel

 -dilM    : Mean Dilation of zero voxels  (using non-zero voxels in kernel)
 -dilD    : Modal Dilation of zero voxels (using non-zero voxels in kernel)
 -dilF    : Maximum filtering of all voxels
 -ero     : Erode by zeroing non-zero voxels when zero voxels found in kernel
 -eroF    : Minimum filtering of all voxels
 -fmedian : Median Filtering 
 -fmean   : Mean filtering, kernel weighted (conventionally used with gauss kernel)
 -fmeanu  : Mean filtering, kernel weighted, un-normalised (gives edge effects)
 -s <sigma> : create a gauss kernel of sigma mm and perform mean filtering
 -subsamp2  : downsamples image by a factor of 2 (keeping new voxels centred on old)
 -subsamp2offc  : downsamples image by a factor of 2 (non-centred)

Dimensionality reduction operations:

  (the "T" can be replaced by X, Y or Z to collapse across a different dimension)

 -Tmean   : mean across time
 -Tstd    : standard deviation across time
 -Tmax    : max across time
 -Tmaxn   : time index of max across time
 -Tmin    : min across time
 -Tmedian : median across time
 -Tperc <percentage> : nth percentile (0-100) of FULL RANGE across time
 -Tar1    : temporal AR(1) coefficient (use -odt float and probably demean first)

Basic statistical operations:

 -pval    : Nonparametric uncorrected P-value, assuming timepoints are the permutations; first
            timepoint is actual (unpermuted) stats image
 -pval0   : Same as -pval, but treat zeros as missing data
 -cpval   : Same as -pval, but gives FWE corrected P-values
 -ztop    : Convert Z-stat to (uncorrected) P
 -ptoz    : Convert (uncorrected) P to Z

Multi-argument operations:

 -roi <xmin> <xsize> <ymin> <ysize> <zmin> <zsize> <tmin> <tsize> : zero outside roi (using voxel
      coordinates)
 -bptf <hp_sigma> <lp_sigma> : (-t in ip.c) Bandpass temporal filtering; nonlinear highpass and
       Gaussian linear lowpass (with sigmas in volumes, not seconds); set either sigma<0 to skip
       that filter
 -roc <AROC-thresh> <outfile> [4Dnoiseonly] <truth> : take (normally binary) truth and test current
      image in ROC analysis against truth. <AROC-thresh> is usually 0.05 and is limit of Area-under
      ROC measure FP axis. <outfile> is a text file of the ROC curve (triplets of values: FP TP
      threshold). If the truth image contains negative voxels these get excluded from all
      calculations. If <AROC-thresh> is positive then the [4Dnoiseonly] option needs to be set, and
      the FP rate is determined from this noise-only data, and is set to be the fraction of
      timepoints where any FP (anywhere) is seen, as found in the noise-only 4d-dataset. This is
      then controlling the FWE rate. If <AROC-thresh> is negative the FP rate is calculated from
      the zero-value parts of the <truth> image, this time averaging voxelwise FP rate over all
      timepoints. In both cases the TP rate is the average fraction of truth=positive voxels
      correctly found.

Combining 4D and 3D images:

 If you apply a Binary operation (one that takes the current image and a new image together), when
 one is 3D and the other is 4D,
 the 3D image is cloned temporally to match the temporal dimensions of the 4D image.

e.g. fslmaths input_volume -add input_volume2 output_volume
     fslmaths input_volume -add 2.5 output_volume
     fslmaths input_volume -add 2.5 -mul input_volume2 output_volume

     fslmaths 4D_input_volume -Tmean -mul -1 -add 4D_input_volume demeaned_4D_input_volume
